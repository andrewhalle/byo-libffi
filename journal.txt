[2020-05-06T18:09:15-0700] I can break python by doing `mv /usr/lib/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/alibffi.so.7`
                           then doing `python -c 'import ctypes'` so I can use python as a test case
                           for my libffi clone and install my clone at this location
[2020-05-06T18:11:28-0700] need to set up a virtual machine so I don't completely bork my system.
[2020-05-06T18:12:12-0700] will just use vagrant
[2020-05-06T18:17:06-0700] sudo pacman -S vagrant
                           sudo pacman -S libvirt
                           sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
                           sudo systemctl start libvirtd
                           vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
                           sudo pacman -S ebtables dnsmasq
                           sudo systemctl restart libvirt
                           vagrant init generic/arch
                           vagrant up --provider=libvirt
[2020-05-06T19:36:26-0700] the above was failing on waiting for the IP address for a while, but then
                           worked when I destroyed and re `up`d. weird. anyway, in the box, I can install
                           python, `ldconfig -p | grep ffi` and `rm /usr/lib/libffi.so.7` then try importing
                           ctypes in python, and I get the failure.
